Install the Xpad sticky notes app on Fedora 14:

  sudo yum install xpad

Then add 'xpad' to:

  System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications

I like this app because it puts an icon in the upper-right GNOME panel,
so that you can click the icon and it will instantly foreground all of
the sticky notes.


xpad stores its data in ~/.config/xpad/

If you strace it to track open and write syscalls, you'll notice that it
does a LOT of writes to its data directory.  Since this is stored in
NILFS within ~/home/, all of these writes might be wasteful, so to
optimize later, we might want to move this directory to a non-versioned
filesystem.

Interesting ... xpad continually writes data to a temporary
.goutputstream* file and then renames it to content-* files for
permanent storage ...

rename("/home/researcher/.config/xpad/.goutputstream-FG1X4V", "/home/researcher/.config/xpad/content-GCQD5V") = 0


Code is in XpadTracer.py
