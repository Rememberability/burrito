Example installation of Burrito on Fedora 14 (32-bit) within VirtualBox
2012-01-26

1. Download Fedora 14 32-bit ISO

http://mirror.seas.harvard.edu/fedora/linux/releases/14/Live/i686/Fedora-14-i686-Live-Desktop.iso


2. Do a normal installation of Fedora 14 in VirtualBox (v4.1.4 r74291)

Set up a new VM with 2GB of RAM, 40GB hard drive, VDI dynamically-sized file format

- root password: passwd
- user: researcher
  password: passwd

When installing, do custom hard disk partitioning to shrink the
'lv_root' LVM logical volume (pseudo-partition) and create a new
'lv_home' LVM logical volume mounted in '/home'.

(There's no option to format lv_home as NILFS, so format it as ext4 for
now ... we'll reformat it later.)

Finish installation, eject the Fedora 14 LiveCD ISO image, and reboot.


3. Initial setup:

Do 'su' and then 'visudo' to add user 'researcher' to sudoers

Disable stupid pesky SELinux permanently by editing '/etc/selinux/config' and setting:

  SELINUX=disabled


4. Reformatting /home as NILFS

Backup /home/researcher before reformatting /home into NILFS

  sudo mkdir /home-backup
  sudo rsync -avh /home/researcher /home-backup/

Install nilfs tools before attempting anything else:

  sudo yum install nilfs-utils


Insert the Fedora 14 LiveCD into the VirtualBox virtual CD drive and
then reboot to start a "Live System User" session from the CD-ROM.

  - Using the LiveCD session makes it possible to run commands to muck
    with filesystem-related stuff since the filesystems aren't mounted

Do 'su' in the terminal to change to the root user (no password needed!)

Install nilfs tools for LiveCD session:

  yum install nilfs-utils

Format the lv_home logical volume as NILFS:

  mkfs.nilfs2 /dev/vg_burritofedora/lv_home

Now we need to edit /etc/fstab, but before we can do so, we need to
mount the root partition:

  mkdir root
  mount /dev/mapper/vg_burritofedora-lv_root root/

Now edit /etc/fstab by accessing it through the new root mount:

  vi root/etc/fstab

Edit this line in /etc/fstab to specify that lv_home is actually NILFS
(remember the 'nogc' option to disable the garbage collector):

  /dev/mapper/vg_burritofedora-lv_home /home nilfs2    rw,nogc        0 0

Now remove the LiveCD ISO image and reboot.

Try to log in as 'researcher', and you'll see a bunch of errors since
there's no longer a /home/researcher directory!  Get past all of those
errors, open a terminal, 'su' to become root, and move the backup
researcher/ directory back into /home:

  su
  mv /home-backup/researcher /home/

Now reboot again, and all should be well :)

/home/researcher should now be a NILFS partition with NO garbage
collector.  Run 'mount' to verify.

[... to be continued ...]
